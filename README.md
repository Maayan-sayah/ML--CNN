# ML--CNN
machine learning projects

Machine learning is a field that deals with the development of algorithms designed to allow the computer to learn from examples, and works in a variety of computational tasks in which classical programming is not possible.

In this program we solve the problam with CNN algorithm.
 
 a convolutional neural network is a class of artificial neural network (ANN), most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.
